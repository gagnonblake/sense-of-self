You look familiar
Forget I said that
You're not real
Did you make any new friends today?
It's real quiet tonight
Leave me alone
Wake up
Look at your hands
Nevermind, it doesn't matter
Bury me
Do you know any good jokes?
No
Yeah sure whatever
Where am I?
How did I get here?
Just passing through
I wonder
Do you think the sun will ever come up?
Why are you talking to me?
This happens too often
Why are you staring at me?
...
Oh hi
I love you
Do you watch anime?
My best friend lives in Brazil
I'm worried
Do you see that?
Who is that over there?
Oh, nothing
It's nothing
On second thought
Set me free
You look unwell
Why are you here?
I'm not supposed to be here
I don't remember my childhood
I don't remember how I got here
Things are extra squishy tonight
It feels like someone's following me
It feels like someone's watching me
You're being followed
You're being watched
Just messing with you
Why are my hands so cold?
It's slippery out there tonight
I can't take this anymore
Don't talk to me
Sounds like a you problem
Don't look at me
Leave me alone
I thought this place was abandoned
You weren't here last time I came through
Do you have any proof?
Allegedly
I suppose
The air smells weird tonight
I was just here a moment ago
If I was an animal I would be a lobster
I feel like I'm going in circles
Why are you here?
Who are you?
Are you a cop?
Thanks
No thank you
Please don't hurt me
Do you work here?
You don't work here
Do you feel it?
Is that blood?
I taste blood
You're pretty cool
Don't come to work tomorrow
I wonder what it's like out there
Be kind
Don't do drugs
Why are things like this
I missed you so much
I don't like getting kicked in the head anymore
I can make some huge numbers in the calculator app
I'm looking for a door
What's your favorite planet?
How was your day?
They forgot that Iâ€™m him
I know a lot of facts about fish
I can be your bad news
Sorry I'm dyslexic
Name all of the aquatic animals
They call me Lil Bargain Bin
Please don't percieve me
I'm sort of a scholar
Please pray for me
This is not a drill
Can't sleep
Get real
They call me The Gulp Lord
I'm not leaving
Ask me how big my backpack is
Would you still love me if I was a worm?
Wanna see a dead body?
I think I'm fairly important in the grand scheme of things
Why now?
Did you drop this?
Sorry, I can't hear you
Why is your head so big?
I lost my child
I'm so tired
Did you know?
Thank you
I'm so fast
Hello
Did you need something?
This isn't my real name
I haven no idea how I got here
Get some rest
You just don't get it
You'll never understand
hehe
Can I get uhhhhh...
Hell yeah
Change the world
My final message
Goodbye
Come closer
Oh it's you
My enemies fear me
I left a bunch of money somewhere around here
Wait
Do crimes
I am trying to be more problematic
I want to be a better person
Where did my friends go?
You can't fool me
How are the kids?
Make them pay
I don't need my eyes to see
Open your third eye
Quick, hide
No...
No!
No?
It just keeps happening
It's all the same
What day is it?
Why is it always so dark here?
What year is it?
I'm from the future
I'm from the past
Future me is my enemy
Do you get it?
You're just as lost as me
I could've had everything
I will never understand
It's ok
You're ok
Oh wow
That's a lot of blood
Hey boss
Did you come to check up on me?
Hey check this out
I've been told that this is all there is
I hope you make it
All my friends are dead
Just kidding
When is the last time I ate?
Where did I put my keys?
Are you ok?
This place is too big
This place is too small
I was on television once
Attend to your responsibilies
No mercy
When will I wake up?
One at a time, please
Nobody told me what I need to do
This has happened before
What cycle are you on?
How long has it been?
If only
Wait, what?
What?
I don't know
I know everything
I can't help you with that
Please don't involve me
Aliens are real
Our world is flat and I can prove it
I love coming back here
Where do we go when we die?
I can't do this much longer
Wanna know how high I can count?
I came here with my friend
The accident really messed me up
I told them you were living
Not you again
You look just like everybody else
You're not as important as you think you are
There are places that aren't here
There are people that aren't us
haha
