You look familiar
Forget I said that
You're not real
Did you make any new friends today?
It's real quiet tonight
Leave me alone
Wake up
Look at your hands
Nevermind, it doesn't matter
Bury me
Do you know any good jokes?
No
Yeah sure whatever
Where am I?
How did I get here?
Just passing through
I wonder
Do you think the sun will ever come up?
Why are you talking to me?
This happens too often
Why are you staring at me?
...
Oh hi
I love you
Do you watch anime?
My best friend lives in Brazil
I'm worried
Do you see that?
Who is that over there?
Oh, nothing
It's nothing
On second thought
Set me free
You look unwell
Why are you here?
I'm not supposed to be here
I don't remember my childhood
I don't remember how I got here
Things are extra squishy tonight
It feels like someone's following me
It feels like someone's watching me
You're being followed
You're being watched
Just messing with you
Why are my hands so cold?
It's slippery out there tonight
I can't take this anymore
Don't talk to me
Sounds like a you problem
Don't look at me
Leave me alone
I thought this place was abandoned
You weren't here last time I came through
Do you have any proof?
Allegedly
I suppose
The air smells weird tonight
I was just here a moment ago
If I was an animal I would be a lobster
I feel like I'm going in circles
Why are you here?
Who are you?
Are you a cop?
Thanks
No thank you
Please don't hurt me
Do you work here?
You don't work here
Do you feel it?
Is that blood?
I taste blood
You're pretty cool
Don't come to work tomorrow
I wonder what it's like out there
Be kind
Don't do drugs
Why are things like this
I missed you so much
I don't like getting kicked in the head anymore
I can make some huge numbers in the calculator app
I'm looking for a door
What's your favorite planet?
How was your day?
They forgot that Iâ€™m him
I know a lot of facts about fish
I can be your bad news
Sorry I'm dyslexic
Name all of the aquatic animals
They call me Lil Bargain Bin
Please don't percieve me
I'm sort of a scholar
Please pray for me
This is not a drill
Can't sleep
Get real
They call me The Gulp Lord
I'm not leaving
Ask me how big my backpack is
Would you still love me if I was a worm?
Wanna see a dead body?
I'm fairly important in the grand scheme of thing
Why now?
Did you drop this?
Sorry, I can't hear you
Why is your head so big?
